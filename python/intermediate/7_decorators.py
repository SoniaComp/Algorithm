they are functions which modify the functionality of other functions.
make your code more concise.

* In Python we can define functions inside other functions.
* Returning functions from within functions.
* Giving a function as an argument to another function.

Decorators with Arguments
This is because when you use the @my_decorator syntax, you are applying a wrapper function with a single function as a parameter. Remember, everything in Python is an object, and this includes functions! With that in mind, we can write a function that returns a wrapper function.
